# README

Micro-reddit exercise done through The Odin Project.
This exercise aimed to familiarize students with Ruby on Rails and 
model associations (belongs_to, has_many), and creating linked relational models.

It also allowed us to introduce basic validations, such as ensuring a field
is present (presence: true), lengths, etc.
